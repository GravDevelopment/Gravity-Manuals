# Where these manuals came from

**Single source of truth: the SharePoint `Manuals` folder.**

> [Open it in SharePoint](https://gravitygh.sharepoint.com/sites/GravityGH/Gravity%20GH/Forms/AllItems.aspx?id=%2Fsites%2FGravityGH%2FGravity%20GH%2FGravity%20Data%2FGravity%20Training%2FB%20Training%2FDesign%20and%20Development%2FManuals)
>
> `gravitygh.sharepoint.com/sites/GravityGH` → Gravity GH → Gravity Data →
> Gravity Training → B Training → Design and Development → **Manuals**

Imported 2026-09-01. Every file the portal serves is in that folder, but not
every file in the folder is served (see *Not served* below). The older
`Gravity Internal Training Course Material` library is no longer used as a
source — the translations that only existed there were copied across.

**These files are still a snapshot, not a live feed.** Replacing a PDF in
SharePoint does not change the portal until someone repeats the refresh below.

"Doc code" is the revision string printed inside the PDF itself — the reliable
way to tell which revision a file really is, since filenames drift.

## Not served

These remain in the SharePoint folder but are deliberately not in the portal.
They were not deleted from SharePoint — if that is wanted, remove them there too,
then refresh `BASELINE.json` so the drift check stays clean.

- **`GTMML Manual.pdf`** — a 4-page assessor marking sheet (`GTMML_POE_Rev 1.1`,
  "Assessor to mark A for achieved or NYA"), not a learner manual. Because of
  this the four **Manual and Mechanical Lifting** courses (150kg/500kg, SA/Int)
  have no manual. A real MML learner manual needs to be added to the folder.
- **`GTTVT_LM_Rev 1.pdf`** (Tower Verticality Testing) — withdrawn 2026-09-02 on
  request. The "Tower Verticality Testing" course now shows no manual.
- **`GTLOF Manual.pdf`** (Line of Fire) — withdrawn 2026-09-02 on request. No
  Dataverse course referenced it anyway.
- **`GTRFA Manual (Portuguese).pdf`** and **`GTRFA Manual (Urdu).pdf`** —
  withdrawn 2026-09-02 on request. Radio Frequency Awareness now offers English
  and French only. (These two were uploaded to SharePoint by the import; delete
  them there if they shouldn't be kept.)

## Flagged for a human check

- **`fabr-ur.pdf`** — filename says Urdu and the file is 17.6 MB for 71 pages,
  but there is no Urdu text layer in the first 25 pages (only Latin characters),
  so the Urdu is presumably page images. Nobody has confirmed the content is
  actually Urdu.
- **`gvs.pdf`** — the only file with no revision code and no course-overview
  page. Reads as a product specification ("Scope and intent", "Design",
  "Fall clearance") rather than a course manual. Mapped to the two GVS Installer
  courses on the assumption that is intentional.
- **`ifpp-fr.pdf`** — titled "MISE EN ŒUVRE D'UN PLAN DE PROTECTION" (Implement a
  Fall Protection Plan, correct) but its footer reads `GLCMLLM02_Rev 2`, which is
  a Mechanical Lifting code. Wrong footer in Gravity's source document.
- **`tower-erector-fr.pdf`** — titled "MONTEUR DE PYLÔNES" (Tower Erector,
  correct) but the opening line says "Le cours de Levage Mécanique"
  (Mechanical Lifting). Wrong intro sentence in the source document.
- **`afr.pdf`** is mapped to the plain **Fall Arrest Rescue** courses as well as
  the Advanced ones, because no separate non-Advanced manual exists anywhere.
- **`rope-rigging.pdf`** (`Rev 3.3`) and **`mechanical-lifting.pdf`** (`Rev 2.1`)
  are *older* than the versions the old library held (`Rev 4` and `Rev 3`). The
  new folder was taken as authoritative, but this may have been accidental.

## Courses with no manual

Basic Slinging · Commercial Banner Flighting · Confined Space Entry · Confined
Space Rescue · First Aid Training · High Angle Level 1 · IRATA (all) · Legal
Liability · Manual and Mechanical Lifting (all four) · Rooftop Worker ·
Supervision Level 3 · Floorplan Inspection · Inspect Gear KITS ·
Tower Verticality Testing

Learners on these see "Manual not available yet" and are pointed at
certification@gravitygh.co.za.

`fplu.pdf` (Fallprotec Securail) is imported but no Dataverse course name
matches it yet, so nothing links to it.

## Refreshing a manual

1. Replace the PDF in the SharePoint `Manuals` folder above.
2. Copy it into `api/manuals/` under the same served name from the table.
3. Check the doc code on an inside page and update the table (bytes +
   `sha256sum`).
4. Deploy: `cd api && func azure functionapp publish gravity-manuals-api`

No site rebuild is needed — the PDFs ship with the API, not the website.

## Adding a language

Name it `<served-name>-<iso639-1>.pdf` (e.g. `bfa-fr.pdf`) and add it to the
matching entry in [`../src/manuals.ts`](../src/manuals.ts). Language names shown
to learners come from `LANGUAGES` in that file.
